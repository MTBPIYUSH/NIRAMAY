# Niramay Platform Testing Framework & Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on code analysis, this document provides a comprehensive testing framework for the Niramay waste management platform. The platform consists of three main user roles (Citizen, Admin, Sub-worker) with distinct workflows and features.

## Critical Issues Identified 🚨

### 1. Missing Admin Dashboard Component
- **Issue**: `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` is listed as existing but not shown in project files
- **Impact**: Admin functionality cannot be tested
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Recommendation**: Implement AdminDashboard component immediately

### 2. Authentication Dependencies
- **Issue**: Multiple environment variables required (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY, VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY)
- **Impact**: Core functionality will fail without proper configuration
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Google Maps Integration
- **Issue**: Potential multiple script loading causing errors
- **Impact**: Location features may malfunction
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
